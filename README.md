Repository with my solutions for "Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs" (SICP) by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.

Used DrRacket version 8.2.
Done most of exercises from chapter 1 through 4.
Did not compare with anyones solutions, because
of it have to be used with caution.
